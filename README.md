# [Playing with shadows and transforms](https://camille.fyrfli.io/shadows/)

This project simply applies some techniques I learned in the [Udemy Fronend Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/front-end-web-development-bootcamp-build-a-twitter-clone/learn/lecture/15018802#overview) course I am doing. It's bascially boxes, shadows, and transforms.

Enjoy!
